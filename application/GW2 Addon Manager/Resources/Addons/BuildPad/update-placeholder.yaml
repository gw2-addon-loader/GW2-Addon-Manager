description: 
    "\"It is essentially a glorified notepad for your builds, allowing you to organize a list of saved builds and copy them with one click.
    It is a plugin to ArcDPS, without the latter it won't work, but then again if you haven't been using ArcDPS for templates already, you probably have no immediate use for this plugin either
    It detects your ArcDPS templates and converts (automatically and/or manually) them to GW2 templates. Your old gear templates, which cannot be pasted into GW2, can however be previewed inside the plugin so you can remind yourself which items and stats you had saved.\""
